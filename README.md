# CatsyBot
A bot dedicated to Star Wars and Fun
# Introduction
This is a bot I started some time ago to have fun with in my server. It is dedicated to Star Wars and Fun (of course) and I am working on adding admin commands. This bot was created in Python 3.9 in PyCharm 2020.3.2
# Commands and Cogs
This bot has about 45 commands and 5 cogs (Economy still being added). The help command is the probably well-known help commmand, the PrettyHelp command. Most of the commands in this bot was taken and modified from other GitHub projects but everything works well. Make sure that before you put my code into your PyCharm or whatever you use, you download PrettyHelp. You can search 'PrettyHelp GitHub' online.
